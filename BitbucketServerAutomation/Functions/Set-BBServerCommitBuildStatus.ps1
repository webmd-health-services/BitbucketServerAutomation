function Set-BBServerCommitBuildStatus
{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Sets the build status of a commit in Bitbucket Server.

    .DESCRIPTION
    The `Set-BBServerCommitBuildStatus` function sets the build status of a specific commit in Bitbucket Server. The status can be in progress, successful, or failed. When a build status is set, Bitbucket Server will show a blue "in progress" icon for in progress builds, a green checkmark icon for successful builds, and a red failed icon for failed builds.

    Data about the commit is read from the environment set up by supported build servers, which is Jenkins. Bitbucket Server must have the commit ID, a key that uniquely identifies this specific build, and a URI that points to the build's report. The build name is optional, but when running under a supported build server, is also pulled from the environment.

    If a commit already has a status, this function will overwrite it.

    .EXAMPLE
    Set-BBServerCommitBuildStatus -Connection $conn -Status InProgress

    Demonstrates how this function should be called when running under a build server. Currently, Jenkins and TeamCity are supported.

    .EXAMPLE
    Set-BBServerCommitBuildStatus -Connection $conn -Status Successful -CommitID 'e24e50bba38db28fb8cf433d00c0d3372f8405cf' -Key 'jenkins-BitbucketServerAutomation-140' -BuildUri 'https://jenkins.example.com/job/BitbucketServerAutomation/140/' -Name 'BitbucketServerAutomation'

    Demonstrates how to set the build status for a commit using your own custom commit ID, key, and build URI.
