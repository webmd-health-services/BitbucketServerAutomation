    .SYNOPSIS
    Creates a new project.

    .DESCRIPTION
    The `New-BBServerProject` function creates a new Bitbucket Server projects. All repositories in Bitbucket Server must be part of a project. Projects are used to group like repositories together.

    Typically, source control repositories should be organized around your code and software, not your teams and organizations. Teams and organizations change more frequently than the technology and purpose of software, so organizing by your code leads to a more stable structure.
