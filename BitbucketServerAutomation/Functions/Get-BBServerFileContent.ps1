    Gets the raw content of a file in a repository.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
    The `Get-BBServerFileContent` function gets the raw content of a file from a repository. Pass the connection to the
    Bitbucket Server to the `Connection` object. Pass the project key of the repository to the `ProjectKey` parameter.
    Pass the repository name to the `RepoName` parameter. Pass the path to the file in the repository to the `Path` 
    parameter. The raw content of the file is returned.

    To retrieve the value of the file at a specific commit, pass the commitish identifier (a tag, hash, branch name, 
    etc.) to the `Commitish` parameter.
