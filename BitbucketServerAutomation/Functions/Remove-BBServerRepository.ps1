    .SYNOPSIS
    Remove a repository from Bitbucket Server.

    .DESCRIPTION
    The `Remove-BBServerRepository` deletes a repository from Bitbucket Server. This is a dangerous operation as all related data is also deleted. You will have to confirm the deletion. To force the deletion without being confirmed, use the `Force` switch.

    Use the `New-BBServerConnection` function to create a connection object to pass to the `Connection` parameter.

    .EXAMPLE
    Remove-BBServerRepository -Connection $conn -ProjectKey 'BBSA' -Name 'fubarsnafu'

    Demonstrates how to delete a repository. Because deleting a repository is a high-impact operation, you will asked to confirm the deletion.

    .EXAMPLE
    Remove-BBServerRepository -Connection $conn -ProjectKey 'BBSA' -Name 'fubarsnafu' -Force

    Demonstrates how to delete a repository, skipping any confirmation dialogs. This can be dangerous since deletions can't be undone. Use the `Force` switch with care.

    .EXAMPLE
    Get-BBServerRepository -Connection $conn -ProjectKey 'BBSA' -Name 'snafu' | Remove-BBServerRepository -Connection $conn

    Demonstrates that you can pipe objects returned by `Get-BBServerRepository` to `Remove-BBServerRepository`. When you pipe repository objects, you don't have to provide the project key

    .EXAMPLE
    'fubarsnafu' | Remove-BBServerRepository -Connection $conn -ProjectKey 'BBSA'

    Demonstrates that you can pipe repository names to `Remove-BBServerRepository`. When you do, you *must* also provide the project key.
