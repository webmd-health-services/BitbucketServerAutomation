    .SYNOPSIS
    Disables a hook in a repository.

    .DESCRIPTION
    The `Disable-BBServerHook` function sets the value of the `Enabled` property to `false` for a designated hook in a Bitbucket Server repository.
    
    If you pass a hook key that does not exist in the target repository, an error will be thrown.

    .EXAMPLE
    Disable-BBServerHook -Connection $conn -ProjectKey 'TestProject' -RepoName 'TestRepo' -HookKey 'com.atlassian.bitbucket.server.example-hook-key'

    Demonstrates how to disable a hook with key `com.atlassian.bitbucket.server.example-hook-key` in the `TestRepo` repository.
